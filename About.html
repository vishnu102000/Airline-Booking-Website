        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <h4>Booking a flight and flying to some destination has always
             been seen as a privilege. Itâ€™s a kind of luxury that 
             most of us secretly wish to afford on a regular basis.
              And those who do often develop a taste that gradually 
              morphs into lofty expectations. And airlines must meet 
              those airy expectations in the form of excellent customer 
              service to make the journey a truly once-in-a-life experience for flyers. <br><br>
            Maybe this deeply-ingrained need to feel special while flying has 
            something to do with the great customer service that is always 
            expected of the airline industry. But yes, delivering excellent 
            customer service also has a huge role to play in the success of the aviation industry. <br><br>
