# Airline-Booking-Website
A new website for Airline Ticket Booking

## Getting Started

This website marks the beginning of my journey into web development. 
Itâ€™s a practice project I created while learning HTML. 
The site includes basic information, which I referred to from similar airline websites. 
At the moment, the footer page is missing due to some technical issues. 
Overall, this project showcases the HTML skills I've recently learned.
